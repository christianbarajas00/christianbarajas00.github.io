Hi, I’m Christian Barajas — a 24-year-old senior in Computer Science at the University of Houston, originally from California.

I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through software and bringing ideas to life with code. Previously, I worked as a Junior Software Developer, where I gained hands-on experience building and maintaining applications in the space industry.

Currently, I’m sharpening my skills in full-stack development, web technologies, and software architecture.

My current areas of interest include app development, game development, and cybersecurity. I enjoy working across the full stack, exploring how technology can enhance user experiences, and learning how to secure systems against real-world threats.

I’m continuously expanding my skill set in modern tools and frameworks such as Django, GitHub Pages, and front-end libraries, while also diving deeper into software architecture and secure coding practices.
